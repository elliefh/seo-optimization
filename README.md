# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Overall goal of the project is to make the existing webpage accessible. Specifically, I updated the HTML file to have accurate semantic HTML elements (e.g., header, footer, main, aside, etc. instead of always using div) in a logical structure and easy to understand format (e.g., putting alt descriptions for each image element). The CSS file was updated as well by consolidating CSS selectors and organizing them in a sequential structure.
